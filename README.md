# Future-Nuturers
Teacher's Hack 2 Project

## Inspiration
I have personally seen teachers struggle with their excessive workloads and a lot of tutors unable to reach the number of students they can due to lack of resources. This wastes they talent and skill of several teachers who if given appropriate support can better nurture the future generation. 

## What it does
This project provides a platform where Teachers can register and make themselves visible. Teachers update their profiles with their information, needs and can add crowdsourcing requests. The platform allows the people to donate funds, resources, provide volunteer support(like in preparing notes, questions etc) and students can send their thank you messages and gifts to their teachers. 
Also, we have a forum where the teachers need to post the updates of the support they received in the form of pictures, videos and blogs so that the ones helping out can see the impact that the made(and can make too!). 

## How we built it
The platform is built using Velo by Wix. The forum part is handled using the Velo backend. The Thank You messages are sent using DeSo Blockchain NFTs. Payments are handled using PayPal. Twilio has been used to send the volunteer requests and other notifications to the teachers and users. This has been done using SMS. 
GitHub has been used to implement the DeSo blockchain part. 
The website uses various features built using Velo by Wix
1. CrowdSourcing Project Store
2. Forum for updates and support
3. PayPal Donations
4. Twilio updates(SMS)
5. DeSo NFT Thank you messages for teachers

## Challenges we ran into
As this was my first time working with almost all technologies used, this was very challenging. I had never used Wix before. It seemed very daunting at first. Trying to understand the connection between backend and frontend, how to get the APIs to work and understanding the workings of the secret manager were major challenges. 
Other than this Twilio was a major roadblock as I was using it for the first time and my account was unable to add a new number. Finally with the help of the wonderful mentors and by creating another account, managed to get it working fine!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finally managed to piece it all together within the time! That really felt satisfying

## What we learned
Taking help from mentors and reaching out on the Discord Servers for help is must! That was a key learning. Also, going through documentations and watching tutorials can go a long way. Trying to figure out by yourself can take forever(tried to do that on the first day :<)

## What's next for Future Nurturers
To make it reach to the world! Connect with teachers in my locality then getting teachers from the world as the project progresses. I would want this project to help at least 1 teacher nurture the life of their students!
